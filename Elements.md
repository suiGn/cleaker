On the nature of elements

For that which is the means of obtaining is an element of that which is obtained.

reductio ad absurdum

It is essential that such a treatise should be rid of everything superfluous (for this is an obstacle to the acquisition of knowledge); it should be everything that embraces the subject and brings it to a point (for this is the supreme service to science).

The term element is applied by analogy to that which, being one and small, is useful for many purposes.

For every demonstrative science has to do with three things:
1) The things which are assumed to exist, namely the genus (subject-matter) in each case, the essential properties of which the science investigates.
2) The common axioms so-called, which are the primary source of demonstration, and
3) the properties with regard to which all that is assumed is the meaning of the respective terms used.
