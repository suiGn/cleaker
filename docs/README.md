# CLEAKER

-----------

### [Project Status : Experimental and Under Development, Subject to Major Changes]

The module is in active development, and as such, it is subject to significant changes as we refine our approach and methodologies to best support our goals.

# README

Connecting all points within a fixed distance. 

**Cleaker** is a pronoun representing a [person](https://suign.github.io/this.me/), place, or thing in space and time. 

##### What is cleaker? [click here](https://suign.github.io/pages/cleaker.html).

Its role is to function as a Digital Identifier (DID) creator; make cleaker accept an object (like a .me profile) and return a unique DID for it.

## Install with npm.
```bash
npm i cleaker
```

# Usage Example

Currently under development.

```javascript
import { generateDID } from 'cleaker';

const profile = { /* .me profile data */ };

// Generate a DID using SHA-256
const didSHA256 = generateDID(profile, 'SHA-256');
console.log('DID (SHA-256):', didSHA256);

// Generate a DID using Keccak-256
const didKeccak256 = generateDID(profile, 'Keccak-256');
console.log('DID (Keccak-256):', didKeccak256);
```



By implementing both `SHA-256` and `Keccak-256`, `cleaker` becomes a versatile tool for creating DIDs that are compatible with major blockchain networks. This approach allows for the integration of **cleaker** with a variety of blockchain technologies and potentially opens up various use cases in the **blockchain domain.**

**Each module** in **[all.this](https://neurons.me/all-this)** represents a specific **datastructure**. These classes encapsulate the functionalities and **data specific to their domain.**

## **Utils**

**[all.this](https://neurons.me/all-this)** not only aggregates these modules but also provides utilities to facilitate the integration, management, and enhancement of these data structures. **For example:**

*The integration with [cleaker](https://suign.github.io/cleaker/) ensures each module instance has a **unique cryptographic identity**, enhancing security and data integrity.*
