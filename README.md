# Basic Usage
1. **Importing Cleaker**: Import the Cleaker class by requiring it from where it's defined.
   
   ```js
   const Cleaker = require('./cleaker');
   ```

# Dynamic Interaction:

### Enable dynamic interactions within spaces, allowing different interpretations of the same namespace based on user context.

Implementing the concept of **"Spaces"** in **Cleaker,** where data within a certain space can be represented or interpreted differently depending on the user. This paradigm ensures that users can instantiate their unique contextual environment or "**space**," interacting seamlessly with their data in a user-specific manner. 

**Unique Interpretation:** In this conceptual space, data representations are unique to the user. For example, the same namespace can hold an image of a cat for one user and an image of a man for another. This dynamic approach ensures tailor-made interactions and experiences for every user.

**Secure and Personalized Interaction:** With Cleaker, users are not just interacting with the system; they are establishing their private namespaces, securing their interactions and information uniquely. Every piece of information is secured and can only be read or interpreted by the user who left it.

Dynamic Interaction refers to the real-time and adaptable interactivity within these spaces, allowing users to interpret and interact with data or elements in ways unique to their context or preferences.

#### Example:
```javascript
userSpaceInstance.interact({ type: 'click', target: 'image' }); // The interaction will be handled differently based on userâ€™s space and preferences.
```

### Implementation of Namespaces with Cleaker:
Cleaker being a pronoun representing a person, place, or thing in space and time. By defining namespaces based on Cleaker instances, you ensure that each namespace is unique, identifiable, and contextual to the specific user, thus facilitating seamless and meaningful interactions within the network.

#### Namespacing Example:
If Cleaker is an identifier, like `cleaker123`, then a possible namespace could be:

```sh
cleaker123:space:images:cat.jpg
```

### Network Accessibility:
Yes, by identifying spaces and creating pathname (or namespace) based on Cleaker instances, you can indeed create paths that are reachable to anyone in the network, provided they have the necessary permissions and access rights. This way, each user, with their Cleaker as a unique identifier, can have their namespaces in the decentralized network, allowing them to interact, share, and collaborate in a more personalized and secure manner.

# Authentication

The process of verifying the identity of a user, system, or application. It answers the question, **"Who are you?"**

**Cleaker** is a pronoun. A **person, place** or **thing** is **space** and **time.**

**Example:** A user logging into a website with a username and password.
Authorization is the process of granting or denying access to specific resources based on an authenticated user's or system's permissions. It answers the question, **"What are you allowed to do?"**

**Example:** Once logged in, a user might be authorized to read content but not edit it.

   ```js
   if (cleaked.authenticate('username', 'password')) {
      console.log('Authenticated successfully');
   }
   ```

6. **Data Signing**: Cleaker can also sign data using the `sign` method if the user is authenticated.

   ```js
   if (cleaked.authenticated) {
      const signature = cleaked.sign('some data');
      console.log('Signature:', signature);
   }
   ```

7. **Device Identification**: Cleaker can generate a unique device identifier.

   ```js
   console.log("Device Identifier:", cleaked.deviceIdentifier);
   ```

# Advanced Usage

The Cleaker class can be extended and customized to add additional functionalities specific to your application. Its methods can be overridden, and new properties can be added as required.

Remember to refer to the `cleaker.js` source code for precise understanding, as implementation details might vary.

1. **Accessing Network Interfaces**: You can access details about network interfaces using `cleaked.networkInterfaces`. This object contains information about each network interface, including IP addresses.

   ```js
   console.log(cleaked.networkInterfaces['en0'].details); // Array of network interface details
   console.log(cleaked.networkInterfaces['en0'].ip); // Array of IPv4 addresses
   ```

2. **Local IP, CPU & Memory Info**: Cleaker provides local IP, CPU architecture, model, and memory details.

   ```js
   console.log("Local IP:", cleaked.localIP);
   console.log("CPU Model:", cleaked.cpu.model);
   console.log("Total Memory:", cleaked.memory.total);
   ```

By employing Cleaker, you gain access to robust features that enhance the security and functionality of your application, enabling streamlined interactions with the operating system and network, and providing essential user management capabilities.
