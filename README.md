## Cleaker Quickstart Guide

Cleaker is a comprehensive module that facilitates various functionalities like retrieving system information, authentication, signing data, and user management. Here's how you can utilize Cleaker:

### Installation

First, make sure to include the `cleaker.js` file in your project, and also have the required modules (`crypto` and `os`) available.

### Basic Usage

1. **Importing Cleaker**: Import the Cleaker class by requiring it from where it's defined.

   ```js
   const Cleaker = require('./cleaker');
   ```

2. **Creating an Instance**: Instantiate a Cleaker object by passing required details like username, password, IP address, etc.

   ```js
   let cleaked = new Cleaker('username', 'password');
   ```

3. **Accessing Network Interfaces**: You can access details about network interfaces using `cleaked.networkInterfaces`. This object contains information about each network interface, including IP addresses.

   ```js
   console.log(cleaked.networkInterfaces['en0'].details); // Array of network interface details
   console.log(cleaked.networkInterfaces['en0'].ip); // Array of IPv4 addresses
   ```

4. **Local IP, CPU & Memory Info**: Cleaker provides local IP, CPU architecture, model, and memory details.

   ```js
   console.log("Local IP:", cleaked.localIP);
   console.log("CPU Model:", cleaked.cpu.model);
   console.log("Total Memory:", cleaked.memory.total);
   ```

5. **Authentication**: Cleaker provides methods for authentication and user management, such as `authenticate`, `login`, and `logout`.

   ```js
   if (cleaked.authenticate('username', 'password')) {
      console.log('Authenticated successfully');
   }
   ```

6. **Data Signing**: Cleaker can also sign data using the `sign` method if the user is authenticated.

   ```js
   if (cleaked.authenticated) {
      const signature = cleaked.sign('some data');
      console.log('Signature:', signature);
   }
   ```

7. **Device Identification**: Cleaker can generate a unique device identifier.

   ```js
   console.log("Device Identifier:", cleaked.deviceIdentifier);
   ```

8. **Other Features**: Cleaker also provides functionalities like recording interactions, user login/logout, verification, and more. Explore the Cleaker class to understand these features.

### Advanced Usage

The Cleaker class can be extended and customized to add additional functionalities specific to your application. Its methods can be overridden, and new properties can be added as required.

Remember to refer to the `cleaker.js` source code for precise understanding, as implementation details might vary.

By employing Cleaker, you gain access to robust features that enhance the security and functionality of your application, enabling streamlined interactions with the operating system and network, and providing essential user management capabilities.
